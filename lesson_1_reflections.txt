When I have a logical unit of work done.

Git wants users to create saves manually. So, git only saves when it is asked to save. This ensures that each save that is created is a meaningful one.

A good rule of thumb is to make one commit per logical change.

Anything that requires change in another documment to make logical sense or work as a whole should be tracked in tandem or togehter :)

A collection of files in git is called a repository.

A commit is a snapshot of everyfile in the repository.
